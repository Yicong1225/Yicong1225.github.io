About Me
------------------------
I am currently a final-year PhD student at Department of Biostatistics, [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/), fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yi-Juan Hu and Prof. Xiang Zhan. Previously, I received my master degree in probability theory and mathematical statistics from Renmin University of China in 2022, and my bachelor degree in statistics from Shandong University in 2019.

Research Interests
------------------------
My research focuses on developing novel statistical methodologies and software for analyzing omics data, with a particular emphasis on microbiome data. I am also broadly interested in high-dimensional statistics and statistical as well as machine learning methods for other omics data.

If you are interested in my research, please feel free to reach out! I would be glad to connect and explore potential collaborations together.
